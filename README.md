## Overview : 

We, the Control System team, work on the simulation and the software system that allows our quadcopter to be controlled remotely and operable autonomously. 
Our mission is to provide a robust, reliable and modular software elements to implement different functions of our drone that enables basic flight, fail safes, payload delivery and autonomy. Using concepts of we tailor each of the algorithms to achieve stable and time efficient flight.
